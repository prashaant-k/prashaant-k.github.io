My research aims to understand and represent cloud systems using deep learning, especially **self-supervised methods** applied to large-scale **satellite imagery**.
 
### 🔬 Current Focus
- Evolution of low-level cloud maturity and transition states
- Foundational models for mesoscale cloud representation
- Compressing spatiotemporal features of satellite BT data
 
### 🔍 Past Work Highlights
- Pretrained contrastive models on SEVIRI IR10.8
- Interfacing satellite embeddings with ground station measurements
- Taxonomy of cloud feature transitions in representation space
