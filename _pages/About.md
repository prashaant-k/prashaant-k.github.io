I am a climate and AI researcher completing my PhD in AI & Satellite Meteorology. My work focuses on **representation learning for cloud systems**, **geostationary satellite data**, and the application of AI in **climate forecasting**.
 
Starting in December, I will begin my postdoctoral research at the **Karlsruhe Institute of Technology**, focusing on AI-driven modeling of evolving low-level cloud systems.
 
I am deeply interested in geospatial machine learning, self-supervised learning, and applications of AI for planetary-scale challenges.
